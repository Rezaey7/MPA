    <div class="page-content4" id="a1"><p>What is atrial fibrillation?</p><br /><p>
        
        Atrial fibrillation is an alteration of the heart rhythm in which the heart area that normally controls the electrical activation (the "sinus node") is "overwhelmed" by the activity of other parts of the right atrium or left atrium (the atria are the upper chambers of the four chambers that make up the heart). As a result the electrical activity of the atria becomes completely chaotic and the heartbeat (pulse) becomes irregular.
        
        
        </p></div>
    <div class="page-content4" id="a2"><p>What are the symptoms?</p><br /><p>
        
       The main symptoms experienced by people suffering from atrial fibrillation are palpitations, or the feeling of an irregular, accelerated heartbeat. Other symptoms include shortness of breath( at rest or during exercise), dizziness, syncope (i.e., loss of consciousness for a few seconds with spontaneous recovery), fatigue, and tiredness. Angina pectoris (chest pains) can also occur.

    <div class="page-content4" id="a3"><p>What are the consequences of atrial fibrillation?</p><br /><p>
        
        Apart from a few exceptional cases, atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia that does not pose a risk to life. However, its complications can be very serious. In fact, atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke.
        
        
        </p></div>
    <div class="page-content4" id="a4"><p>How frequent is atrial fibrillation?</p><br /><p>
        
       Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (about 0.5% in the general adult population). The risk of disease increases with age: in the over 65s, the percentage of people with AF rises to 5% or more. Rarely atrial fibrillation occurs in patients in whom the heart is structurally intact (that is, they have no other demonstrable heart disease). These cases represent approximately 10-15% of all atrial fibrillation patients and can be caused by genetic defects (mutations) and may present familial distribution (that is, this condition “runs in the family”). In most cases however the arrhythmia occurs in patients who have other cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diseases affecting the valves of the heart (valvular disease). For example, 30%-80% of patients who are operated on for mitral valve disease have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation also commonly occurs after all types of cardiac surgery. In these cases, if the diameter of the atria is normal, the arrhythmia almost always disappears after few days.

    <div class="page-content4" id="a5"><p>Are there different types of atrial fibrillation?</p><br /><p>
        
        After a first episode of atrial fibrillation is very important to distinguish whether the arrhythmia was spontaneous (normal heart) or induced by other causes. A careful analysis of symptoms can be of help. Of note, not all episodes of atrial fibrillation are felt/noticed by patients. This can make diagnosis difficult. In patients in whom there were at least two episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous return to sinus rhythm within seven days, atrial fibrillation is called "paroxysmal" (sometimes referred to as “recurrent”). If the episodes last more than 7 days and/or a medical intervention is necessary to restore the normal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation is classified as "persistent". In cases where medical interventions are ineffective and atrial fibrillation persists more than 7 days arrhythmia is defined as "permanent." Of note these categories are not mutually exclusive since a patient may experience transitions from one category to another.

    <div class="page-content4" id="a6"><p>What are the most important consequences of atrial fibrillation?</p><br /><p>
        
       Atrial fibrillation is worrisome for its complications rather than for the arrhythmia itself. Indeed, importantly, since atrial fibrillation often occurs in association with other heart (cardiac) or extra-cardiac diseases (for example, valvular defects, heart chamber enlargement, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension). Thus, the clinical evolution depends also on the so-called "co-morbidity morbidities" (i.e., the "other" heart diseases). Atrial fibrillation is a cause of cardiovascular complications (for example, it can aggravate heart failure), and it causes a reduction in tolerance to physical activity. However, the most severe complication is caused by stagnation of blood in the atrial chambers (due to the loss of coordinated contraction). This promotes the formation of blood clots (thrombi) on the walls of the atrium. If the blood clot detaches it is often dragged by the blood flow to the arteries of the brain (due to anatomical reasons) so they can become clogged causing a stroke. For this reason, patients with atrial fibrillation are commonly treated with anticoagulant drugs.
        
        
        </p></div>
    <div class="page-content4" id="a7"><p>What are the treatment strategies?</p><br /><p>
        
        There are two main treatment strategies: cardioversion, which is the attempt restore the normal “sinus” rhythm (“rhythm control strategy”) or control of heart rate ("rate control strategy”). The rhythm control strategy, if effective, allows minimizing the symptoms and risks described above. It also enables discontinuation of the administration of anticoagulant drugs. The maintenance of sinus rhythm, however, is often difficult or impossible, especially when ultrasound shows an increase in the diameter of the atria. The possibilities of therapy are focused on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs (pills) or radiofrequency ablation. 
        
        
        </p></div>
    <div class="page-content4" id="a8"><p>What is radiofrequency ablation?</p><br /><p>
        
       Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an invasive procedure aimed and creating thin scars in the atria in order to interrupt the arrhythmia. The idea is that by creating these scars (using radio waves) the electrical conduction of the arrhythmias is made impossible. There are different ways of performing RFA but all of them require inserting a wire (catheter) in the right and left atria.  The catheters are usually inserted through the femoral vein and femoral artery (other approaches can be used). The doctor first records a map of the electrical activation of the atria to select the best zone to apply the RF energy. Than he/she deliver a series of electrical impulses and re-checks the electrical activation map to assess the effects of the RFA treatment.  At the end of the procedure the doctor tries to induce atrial fibrillation to demonstrate that the arrhythmia is no longer inducible. In some instances the ablation is not complete and the arrhythmias can recur even if the initial result of RFA is satisfactory.
        
        </p></div>
    <div class="page-content4" id="a9"><p>Which is the most effective therapy?</p><br /><p>
        
        The most important concept to consider is that the efficacy of the therapy depends on the cardiac co-morbidities. For example therapy is more effective for atrial fibrillation occurring in the structurally normal heart than for one occurring in patients with valvular heart disease and with enlarged atria diameter. Therefore treating the cause of atrial fibrillation is at least as important as treating the arrhythmia.  Neither drugs nor ablation are completely effective and the possibility of recurrent atrial fibrillation is between 40% and 50%. Ablation technique has made remarkable advancements in the last few years. However for several patients rate control strategy is the only feasible option. In such instances the correct use of drugs to optimize the cardiac rate (at rest and during exercise) and the administration of anticoagulants is extremely important to improve the patient’s  quality of life.
