    <h1 class="b-header">Interview with Michele</h1><br />
    
    <h2 class="s-heading">Part 1</h2><br />
    <p>As a first, very general question, we asked him which are the major obstacles to compliance with the different therapies. Michele said that compliance has never been an issue for him, he always takes regularly his pills. He also gave an explanation for that: “I know that during a chronic treatment it’s important to avoid big changes in drug concentration  in our body, and this is just what happens when you skip doses. I want to be protected by the drug during the whole day, it’s my convenience.”</p><br />
    <p>Of course it is not common to get such an explanation by a patient. Thus we asked Michele if he received that information/knowledge from some physicians. But he answered that nobody gave him explanations about drugs and about the importance of compliance. He recognized that this is an issue for many patients, and that he would have appreciated more explanations from his doctors. On the other hand, he told that when he asked something to doctors, they provided satisfactory answers (that’s to say that doctors are not proactive in giving spontaneous explanations).
    </p><br />
    <ul>
    <li>Amiodarone (the antiarrhythmic drug) shows a long-term toxicity (again, this is an information that Michele knows, but the most of patients do not): “I’m getting old, and I would like to avoid damaging my liver or my kidneys, that would be a big problem in some years”.</li><br />
        <li>AF symptoms were worsening. He had a couple of episodes with associated severe dizziness  that also led to hospital admission.  Also his wife was becoming stressed for those episodes.</li><br />
        <li>Multiple drug regimen in the long term caused a continuous sense of fatigue.</li><br />
        <li>“Ablation is a surgical intervention, and if it is my last chance to recover from AF symptoms, it’s better to do it now “(Michele is 78 years old).</li>
    </ul>
        <br /><br />
    <h2 class="s-heading">Part 2</h2> <br />
        <p>Q1: Taking warfarin, do you know you have to be careful with diet? You should not to change too much food habits with regard to foods containing vitamin K (e.g., green salad). Have you always been careful about this? Do this dietary care bother you?
        </p><br />
        <p>A: I have been abundantly and very carefully informed by doctors and nurses (specialized about OAC – oral anticoagulants) on green leaf foods, lentils, cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, etc. Consequently, except for lettuce, broccoli and asparagus, which I banished from the table, I eat habitually other vegetables included beans, taking care to vary the type but not the quantity, to keep the vitamin K intake range quite uniform. It goes without saying that the diet does not bother me.

        </p><br />
        <p>
        Q2: With regard to atrial fibrillation, you said there is often the fear that a new episode will come. Is this fear a bit always there?
        </p><br />
        
        <p>
         A: More than fear is the hassle of having to endure fibrillation, while fear is linked to a possible episode of TIA (transient ischemic attack) and hence the thought goes to the effective pharmacological coverage.   
        </p><br />
        
        <p>Q3: Do you think about it every day or just after the occurrence of an episode?</p><br />
        
        
        <p>A: Unfortunately, the onset of AF symptoms is unpredictable, it may happen during day or night, I daily use the blood pressure device to check not only the pressure but also the heartbeats (sometime episodes are asymptomatic). When a symptomatic episode ends, I only think about recovering to normal and happy life!</p><br />
        
        
        <p>Q4: Do you still think about that, after your ablation (last march)?</p><br />
        
        
        <p>A: This aspect improved a lot, I do not think so much to AF because the symptoms, after ablation, do not appear (at least until now) , so the daily life is no more compromised</p><br />
        
        
        <p>Q5: What does it mean for you to be engaged in your treatment?</p><br />
        
        
        <p>A: It means to have counseling and explanations by my caregivers and understand the mechanisms of the disease and of the treatment, in such a way that I may face the problems more efficiently, and solve the minor problems by myself. I also like very much to be involved in research projects and to experiment new devices. Now that I am retired, this reminds me of the time I worked (Michele was a technician in an Otolaryngology ward).</p><br />
