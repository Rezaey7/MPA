        <h1>Being Engaged</h1><br />
    <p>We are hoping that the activities that follow will help you understand how you can become better at managing your atrial fibrillation (AF). We call that being an engaged patient. What does it mean to be engaged? As an engaged patient, you will be in committed and in charge of seeking information about the disease, its possible management interventions, health risks from deviating from them and their consequences, monitoring when your health state changes and making informed choices. For example, you will understand how your risks of stroke and of intracranial bleeding will change if you take different possible medications, and how they will be affected by your deviations from taking medications as directed or from eating food or drinking certain drinks that may counterbalance the medications. You will understand what disabilities may result from these risks and what restriction are placed when you take different medications, and how these will affect your length and quality of life. When you will be informed, you would be able to weigh in all these factors and decide for yourself for example, what to do if you missed a dose by 1 hour, by 12 hours, by 18 hours? How eating Spinach salad may increase your risk of bleeding, and how often you could still eat this favorite salad of yours and not increase your risk too much. You would understand when you need to consider changing or modifying your treatment intervention and talk to your doctor about it and what you should be watching or and noting as you manage your health.</p><br />
    <p>If you will be interested to be engaged, there are ways in which we could help you learn how to do this. You can decide to sign up for a course that our hospital is offering or we could be sending you information that would help you to learn more, to become more motivated and more engaged. You will be moving forward just reading and listening to our explanations and advice.
        </p><br />
    <p>Practically, this means that you will be spending 3 minutes a day before going to bed reflecting on whether you have been taking your medications as directed, have posed risks to bleeding that day, and how many AF episodes you’ve experienced that day. Then, once a week, you should summarize to yourself if you’ve observed some change in your health or your risky behavior, and if so, act upon it. Because you will use the app to report symptoms and risky events in real time, the app will show you at your indicated bedtime, a link to the summary of your daily and weekly reports, so it would be easy for you to reflect.
